<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>Hey! My name is Camryn Reid. I'm 17 years old and currently live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I am captain of my schools girls swim team, president of the Latin club, and Head of Makeup for the Drama Club. I am doing the Summer Immersion Program through Girls Who Code in Washington D.C. this summer and hope to take what I learn here back to my school to start a club at my school. I hope that I can help inspire other high school girls to learn how to code as well.</p>
